# Advent of Code 2020

This is somehow my first year doing AoC. I guess because I always seem to miss December 1st and 2nd and then my anxiety
won't let me start late. Well not this year!

For my first AoC I want to make it special, so I will be attempting to use a different language for every challenge. By
the end I imaging I'll be pushing it a bit.


| Day | Language |
| --- | -------- |
| 01  | C        |
